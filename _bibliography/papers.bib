abstract = {The extraordinary diversity and adaptive fit of organisms to their environment depends fundamentally on the availability of variation. While most population genetic frameworks assume that random mutations produce isotropic phenotypic variation, the distribution of variation available to natural selection is more restricted, as the distribution of phenotypic variation is affected by a range of factors in developmental systems. Here, we revisit the concept of developmental bias – the observation that the generation of phenotypic variation is biased due to the structure, character, composition, or dynamics of the developmental system – and argue that a more rigorous investigation into the role of developmental bias in the genotype-to-phenotype map will produce fundamental insights into evolutionary processes, with potentially important consequences on the relation between micro- and macro-evolution. We discuss the hierarchical relationships between different types of variational biases, including mutation bias and developmental bias, and their roles in shaping the realized phenotypic space. Furthermore, we highlight the challenges in studying variational bias and propose potential approaches to identify developmental bias using modern tools.}

    abstract = "{How do selection and standing genetic variation shape population divergence across landscapes?Henry and Stinchcombe (2023a) estimated selection gradients on traits in the ivy-leaved morning glory (Ipomoea hederacea) in the field and compared them with the G-matrix and population divergence for four populations in North America. The authors show that population divergence and genetic covariances are largely unaligned with the selection gradient at the species’ range edge. These findings raise the question of whether limited evolvability or multivariate genetic variation of populations at range edges prevent species from range expansion, which is important for understanding the role of genetic constraint in population divergence and predicting local adaptation in the face of climate change.}",
