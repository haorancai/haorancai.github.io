<!--
I received my B.S. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2019 and I visited Harvard Medical School in [Hormoz Lab](https://hormoz.dfci.harvard.edu/) in 2018.   -->

I am currently a graduate student at MIT in [Des Marais Lab](https://sites.google.com/mit.edu/des-marais-group/home). I use both empirical and theoretical approaches to understand evolutionary complexity, innovation, and diversity through the lens of development and systems biology. My main research question is to ask how fundamental principles governing developmental systems shape our thinkings about evolutionary, quantitative, and population genetics.
