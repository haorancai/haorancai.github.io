    abstract = "{How do selection and standing genetic variation shape population divergence across landscapes?Henry and Stinchcombe (2023a) estimated selection gradients on traits in the ivy-leaved morning glory (Ipomoea hederacea) in the field and compared them with the G-matrix and population divergence for four populations in North America. The authors show that population divergence and genetic covariances are largely unaligned with the selection gradient at the speciesâ€™ range edge. These findings raise the question of whether limited evolvability or multivariate genetic variation of populations at range edges prevent species from range expansion, which is important for understanding the role of genetic constraint in population divergence and predicting local adaptation in the face of climate change.}",
